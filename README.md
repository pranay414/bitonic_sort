# Bitonic Sort
Bitonic sort is one of the fastest sorting networks. A sorting network is a special kind of sorting algorithm, where the sequence of comparisons is not data-dependent. This makes sorting networks suitable for implementation in hardware or in parallel processor arrays.

The sorting network bitonic sort consists of `Θ(n·log(n)2)` comparators. It has the same asymptotic complexity as odd-even mergesort and shellsort. Although a sorting network with only `O(n·log(n))` comparators is known [AKS 83], due to its large constant it is slower than bitonic sort for all practical problem sizes.
